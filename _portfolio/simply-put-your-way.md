## Summary

Simply Put Your Way is a business dedicated to home organization.  For some extra practice I chose to code up all of the front-end for the site.  I utilized HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap and Animate.css.  The entire mockup is fully responsive as well.  This project was the first that I worked on where I really got to know the fundamentals of Twitter's Bootstrap and it's inner workings.
