## Summary

Wikipedia is universal, and to be able to build a replica for one of my first projects is incredible.  WikiLand allows users to create and collaborate on their own wikis privately or publicly.  This was a school project that I built while enrolled in Bloc Inc.'s full-stack web developer track.

## Explanation

I built WikiLand from the ground up.  The amount of learning that took place within the span of starting and finishing this project is irreplaceable.  With Ruby on Rails powering the core, I have been able to tackle and strengthen my skill-set on various web development topics.  I have learned to incorporate user authentication with the Devise gem, as well as establishing wikis that can be created, read, updated and deleted.  I've also overcome challenges of designating various user roles by utilizing different authorization scopes via the Pundit gem and also incorporated Stripe to allow upgrading from a free plan to a premium one.  Wikis can be set to private, be made collaborative (premium accounts only) and are created and editable with the option of using markdown syntax thanks to the Redcarpet gem.  

## Problem

The internet is a place rich with knowledge which is also easily accessible.  By design, the web was created in order to connect the world together and share this knowledge with one another.  Knowledge should be made universal, because as a human race we all face the same life challenges.  Through shared information from all around there is no telling what answers we may find.

## Solution

WikiLand simplifies the process of sharing knowledge online.  Users have the ability to publicly, as well as collaboratively, create and display wikis ranging from an endless possibility of topics.

## Results

WikiLand has been proven to be simple and intuitive to use and is fully responsive.

## Conclusion

The goal that was aimed to be accomplished with WikiLand was definitely achieved.  The simplicity in its usability made for a powerful tool that anyone can use.  As my first real project working with Rails it was easy to become overwhelmed at times because there was so much to absorb.  However, as an aspiring developer I was pleasantly surprised with the intuitive nature that Rails revolves around.  I have learned countless lessons and core fundamental development skills upon completing this project that will absolutely be recycled throughout my career.
