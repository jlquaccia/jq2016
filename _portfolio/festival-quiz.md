## Summary

Do you even festival? Inspired by true 'festival-related' events, I decided to have a little fun and test the trivial knowledge of others on the subject. Powered by lots of jQuery and JavaScript, it was an interesting experience putting this one together. Being that this was one of my very first projects I can say that I definitely learned a lot of web development fundamentals including a thing or two I hadn't already known about these festival things.
