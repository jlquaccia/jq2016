title: Goals as a Web Developer
---

As an aspiring web developer, the main goal that I have is also the same thing that got me so interested in development in the first place, to simply build cool things.  The more difficult the project the more satisfying the the reward upon completion.  I would love for nothing more than to have full control whenever I tackle any project, which is the reason why I chose to embark down the road of full stack development as opposed to limiting myself to just front-end or just backend.  Yes, full control.  I want it.

Throughout the years of my career it is inevitable that I will have to adapt to quickly changing technologies whether it be languages or frameworks.  However, I aim to master the current stack of languages and frameworks that I have been working with most often, most notably HTML, SCSS, Ruby, jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Rails, etc.  I want these tools to feel second nature to me.

Of course, like anyone else with a passion to code I aim to make it into a career.  My goal is to get hired as a jr. web developer and to work my way up the ladder from there.  Ideally I would like to start out as part of a team and then gradually phase into freelance.  Though I would rather work in an office, the idea of working remotely holds its appeals as well, especially if I were all of a sudden to get the travel bug.

I love learning, and up to this point I've had a constant hunger to learn as much as I can about web development and have experienced no signs of this appetite ever going away.  It's important to stay hungry and keep your mind moving.  Fortunately I have a strong passion for coding and passion makes a person.  Surely if I follow mine I will be lead to achieve my dream.
