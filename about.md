<div class="about_main_content">
  I'm from San Carlos, CA and am absolutely passionate about coding.  I'm currently halfway through my enrollment with Bloc, an online dev bootcamp based in San Francisco, CA.  I'm pursuing their full stack web developer track and am pushing hard to be ready for a jr level developer role by the end of it all.  I was also enrolled in a frontend web development course in the summer of 2014 with Thinkful and have been self taught everywhere else in between.  When I'm not developing code, I love the outdoors, snowboarding, reading, being a musical connoisseur, going to shows, trying new restaurants, netflixing and putting sriracha on everything.  Ah.
